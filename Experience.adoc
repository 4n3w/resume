Senior Solutions Architect on the PCFS team. Worked on engagements with many Fortune-500 companies. Responsible for transforming enterprises via agile processes to introduce practices to deploy, maintain and measure Pivotal Cloud Foundry by: educating the customer on treating their Platform as a Product, and putting reliability first by way of implementing solid Engineering practices via Site (Platform) Reliability Engineering. Led by example: ceremonies practiced with the customers fostered change at the grass-root level (standups, iteration planning meetings, value stream mapping, 2x2s, demos, retros, branding exercises, etc) and served as an archetype for change in these companies. Pair programming was the norm, test-driven development and user centric design helped guide our customers' products to serve as deployment targets for hundreds/thousands of developers.

Regular practices included terraform centric management of the infrastructure (as code) for vSphere, AWS, Azure and GCP. Tests were regularily used to validate configuration and environmental sanity. Concourse was used to act as the continuous GitOps CI/CD and drove product install/feature upgrades/security patches. Site reliability engineering practices were instilled in customer teams to help identify Service Level Indicators for the platform and establish Service Level Objectives for the platform and its dependent systems. Chaos engineering principles and practices were conducted at regular cadences to help further increase reliability numbers.
