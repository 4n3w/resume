# Andrew's Resume

Installing this should be pretty simple. Requirements:

1. Ruby
2. Bundle
3. Bash

I'd recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme) and once that is done, run:

    gem install bundle; bundle

You should be able to then execute

    ./generate.sh 

And you should see a pdf open up (assuming you're using a Mac).
